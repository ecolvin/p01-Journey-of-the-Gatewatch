        You attempt to talk some sense into him. You explain what happened the
        last time the guilds were at war and why that can't happen again. After
        talking for a while, you finally manage to convince Tibalt to go start
        some chaos elsewhere that doesn't risk destroying an entire plane.
        Congratulations, you helped save Ravnica.
