        As you walk into the Rakdos guild, you get an uneasy feeling about this
        place. Suddenly you see a figure in front of you. As you approach him,
        he turns around to confront you. He introduces himself as Tibalt, the
        Fiend-Blooded and admits that he is indeed trying to pit the guilds
        against one another. He explains, however, that he doesn't want to do it
        for any specific reason, he just wants to watch the chaos. What will you
        do know?
