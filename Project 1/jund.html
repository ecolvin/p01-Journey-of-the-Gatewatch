        The Jund fighters look ready to attack as you approach their leader who
        appears to be a large and powerful dragon. He looks very unhappy, but
        at least he seems willing to talk. What will you say to him?

        <a href="threat.html" class="leftChoice">Threaten Him</a>
        <p>
          Tell him that if he doesn't call of his army, you will be forced to
          take action against him.

      <div "float: right width: 50%" class="rightChoice">

          Offer to pay him all of your money if he calls off the attack.
