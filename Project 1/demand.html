        At first the head elf is taken aback by your aggression, but he can tell
        that you are powerful and he respects that. Unfortunately, he notifies
        you that the Jund warriors are intruding upon Naya lands and that if the
        Jund do not leave, the Naya will be forced to defend their territory.
        What will you do?
