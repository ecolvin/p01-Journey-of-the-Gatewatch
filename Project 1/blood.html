        The dragon goes across the battlefield and bites the head off of one of
        the opposing elves. The Naya take this as a sign of war and charge in
        for an attack. The war begins, and you are forced to planeswalk away
        before you get caught up in the fighting. Unfortunately you were unable
        to prevent this battle.
