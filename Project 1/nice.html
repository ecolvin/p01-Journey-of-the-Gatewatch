        You explain that the war needs to stop, but the elves just keep ignoring
        your pleas. It seems like they won't listen to reason. What do you want
        to do now?
      </p>
      <div style="float: left; width: 50%" class="leftChoice">
        <a href="jund.html" class="leftChoice">Go talk to the Jund warriors</a>
        <p>
          The Naya forces won't listen to you. Maybe you should see if you can
          reason with the Jund fighters.

      <div "float: right width: 50%" class="rightChoice">

        <p>
          Asking nicely isn't enough. Maybe being more forceful will get the job
          done.
