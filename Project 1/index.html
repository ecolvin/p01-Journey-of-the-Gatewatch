        Welcome to the Blind Eternities, the dimension in between all of the
        planes of the Multiverse. You are a member of the Gatewatch, a group of
        planeswalkers charged with protecting the multiverse and its many
        planes. There are many planes that need your help, but as powerful as
        you are, you can only help them one at a time. Which would you like to
        choose first?

        <p>
          Ravnica is peaceful now that the guildpact has been reinstated,
          however, an evil planeswalker looks to threaten this peace. You must
          go and stop him before he turns the guilds on each other again.

        <p>
          After the Conflux, the Shards of Alara are at war. A war is about
          to ensue between an army of elves from Naya's elf forces and Jund's
          warriors. It is up to you to prevent this fight in order to help
          restore peace to Alara.
