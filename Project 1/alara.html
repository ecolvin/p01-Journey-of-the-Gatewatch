        You safely planeswalk to Alara. When you arrive, you find yourself in
        between two armies that look mad and ready to fight. You have to
        convince these two armies to stop the fighting and bring peace to Alara.
        Which side do you want to talk to first?

        <p>
          The Naya fighters look more intelligent than the Jund warriors. Most
          of them are elves which would suggest that you would likely be able to
          appeal to their reasoning.

      <div "float: right width: 50%" class="rightChoice">
        <a href="jund.html" class="rightChoice">Jund</a>
        <p>
          The Jund warriors look more ferocious than the Naya forces. They
          definitely can't be reasoned with, but it's possible they could be
          bribed.
