        You have made it safely to Ravnica. Now that you are here, you must find
        the planeswalker that was causing all the trouble.

          Ask around to see if anyone has heard anything about the evil
          planeswalker or knows where he might be.

          Go off and try to find him by yourself. Ravnica is a big place, so it
          may take a while.
