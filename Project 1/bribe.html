        The dragon looks at the money you present in front of him. He accepts
        the money and agrees to call off the war, but still wants to see some
        Naya blood before he leaves. What will you do?
      </p>
      <div style="float: left; width: 50%" class="leftChoice">
        <a href="blood.html" class="leftChoice">Blood</a>
        <p>
          Let him slaughter a Naya soldier to get his blood.

      <div "float: right width: 50%" class="rightChoice">
        <a href="noBlood.html" class="rightChoice">No blood</a>
        <p>
          Tell him that he already has his money and that bloodshed would only
          make matters worse.
