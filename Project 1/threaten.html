        At first Tibalt laughs at your threat. When you take a step forward,
        however, and show that you mean it, he gets a little nervous. Tibalt
        isn't much of a fighter, and no amount of chaos is worth getting beat
        up for, so Tibalt agrees to leave Ravnica alone. Congratulations, you
        helped save Ravnica.
